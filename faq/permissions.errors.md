### 1. Enable file sharing

When using Docker Compose and encountering permissions errors on volume mounts, you might need to enable file sharing or shared folders. This is especially necessary for projects that live outside of the `/home/<user>` directory on Linux and Mac, or for Linux containers on Windows. 

To enable file sharing, you need to go to **Settings**, select **Resources** and then **File sharing**. Share the drive that contains the Dockerfile and volume. For Windows, you need to select **Shared Folders** instead of **File sharing**.

### 2. **Match UID and GID on the Host and Container**

The issue often arises because the UID/GID inside the container doesn't match the UID/GID of the host file system where the volume is mounted. 
To solve this, ensure that the user inside the container has the same UID/GID as the user who owns the files on the host.

You can achieve this by:

- **Specifying the UID/GID in Dockerfile**:
  In your Dockerfile, create a user with the same UID and GID as the host system user.

  ```Dockerfile
  ARG UID=1000
  ARG GID=1000
  RUN groupadd -g $GID mygroup && \
      useradd -u $UID -g $GID -m myuser
  USER myuser
  ```

  In `docker-compose.yml`, pass in the `UID` and `GID` of the host user:

  ```yaml
  services:
    app:
      build:
        context: .
        args:
          UID: "${UID}"
          GID: "${GID}"
      volumes:
        - ./host-dir:/container-dir
  ```

  When running `docker-compose`:

  ```bash
  UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g) docker-compose up
  ```

### 3. **Fix Permissions at Container Start**

You could use an entrypoint or script that adjusts the permissions of the volume at runtime.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    volumes:
      - ./host-dir:/container-dir
    entrypoint: sh -c "chown -R myuser:mygroup /container-dir && exec your-command"
```

This ensures that when the container starts, it will adjust the permissions on the mounted volume to the right user/group before running the main process.
